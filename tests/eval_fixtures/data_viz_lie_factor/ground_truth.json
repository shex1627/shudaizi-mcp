  "description": "Dashboard has multiple Lie Factor violations from Tufte: (1) Bubble chart uses radius proportional to value, but visual perception is area — a 21% revenue increase (4.2→5.1) appears as a 47% increase in area. (2) Bar chart has a truncated Y-axis starting at $4M, exaggerating small differences. (3) 3D pie chart distorts slice areas via perspective tilt. (4) Icon array scales icon size instead of count.",
