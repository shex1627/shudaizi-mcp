  "description": "API gateway uses a single shared ThreadPoolExecutor (10 workers) and a single shared requests.Session for ALL 6 backend services. If any one service (e.g., analytics) becomes slow or hangs, it consumes threads from the shared pool, starving critical paths like checkout and payment. Missing bulkhead isolation — each service (or at least critical vs non-critical) should have its own resource pool.",
