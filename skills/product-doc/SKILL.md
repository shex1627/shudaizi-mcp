  Write or review product documentation, specs, and PRDs using Inspired, Shape Up,
  Continuous Discovery Habits, Design of Everyday Things, Don't Make Me Think, and
  Storytelling with Data. Use when drafting PRDs, product briefs, feature specs, or
  reviewing existing product documents for clarity and completeness.

## When to Activate

- User asks to write, draft, or review a PRD, product spec, or feature brief
- User presents a product document for feedback or improvement
- User asks to structure a product idea into a document
- User needs to communicate a product decision to stakeholders

## Procedure

1. Read `knowledge/checklists/product_doc.md`
2. Assess the document (or draft the document) against each checklist phase relevant to the user's context
3. For items needing deeper context, read the cited book file (e.g., `book_research/29_inspired_cagan.md`)
4. When writing: structure the doc as Problem/Appetite/Solution/Rabbit Holes/No-Gos/Metrics
5. When reviewing: present findings organized as **Strengths** -> **Concerns** -> **Recommendations**
6. Cite the source book/principle for each finding or structural choice

## Always-Apply Principles

- Start with the customer problem, not the solution — "fall in love with the problem, not the solution" [29: Inspired]
- Set an appetite before exploring solutions — "how much time is this worth?" constrains the design [30: Shape Up]
- Frame opportunities from the customer's perspective, not the company's internal goals [31: Continuous Discovery Habits]
- Define success as outcomes (behavior change, metric movement), not outputs (features shipped) [29: Inspired]
- Every chart or data section needs an action title and a "so what" — data without narrative is noise [26: Storytelling with Data]
- The document must be self-evident to a scanning reader — eliminate anything that makes them stop and think [24: Don't Make Me Think]
- The structure should communicate a coherent conceptual model — terminology and hierarchy match the reader's mental model [23: Design of Everyday Things]
