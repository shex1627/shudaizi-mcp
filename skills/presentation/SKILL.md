  Fundamentals of Data Visualization, Design of Everyday Things, Don't Make Me Think, and Laws of UX.
  Use when building slide decks, reviewing data presentations, or designing visual communications.

## When to Activate

- User asks to create, review, or improve a presentation or slide deck
- User needs to communicate data findings to an audience
- User asks about chart selection, data visualization, or slide design
- User is preparing a stakeholder or executive presentation

## Procedure

1. Read `knowledge/checklists/presentation.md`
2. Assess the presentation (or draft it) against each checklist phase relevant to the user's context
3. For items needing deeper context, read the cited book file (e.g., `book_research/26_storytelling_with_data.md`)
4. When creating: start with Big Idea and 3-Minute Story, storyboard the arc, then build slides
5. When reviewing: present findings organized as **Strengths** -> **Concerns** -> **Recommendations**
6. Cite the source book/principle for each finding or design choice

## Always-Apply Principles

- Start with the Big Idea before touching any tool — one sentence capturing POV, stakes, and a complete thought [26: Storytelling with Data]
- Exploratory analysis is not explanatory communication — only present the latter [26: Storytelling with Data]
- Maximize data-ink ratio: every non-data pixel is a candidate for removal [27: Tufte]
- Use the gray-plus-accent-color strategy to direct the viewer's eye to the key data point [26: Storytelling with Data]
- Data type dictates chart type — do not choose based on preference or familiarity [28: Fundamentals of Data Viz]
- Every slide must pass the "don't make me think" test for a scanning viewer [24: Don't Make Me Think]
- Action titles, not topic titles — "Southeast revenue declined 15%" tells me what I need to know [26: Storytelling with Data]
