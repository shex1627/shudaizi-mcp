## Note

This article now redirects to the Claude Code documentation at code.claude.com/docs. The original content has been integrated into the broader Claude Code documentation. See the Claude 4 Best Practices file (21_claude_4_best_practices.md) for the comprehensive prompt engineering guide that supersedes much of this content.

## Original Key Points (from earlier fetches)

### Agent Architecture
- Minimal, well-designed scaffolding outperforms complex frameworks
- Tool design > prompt optimization (SWE-bench finding)
- Bash + Edit tools with flexible prompts

### Workflow
1. Examine repository structure
2. Reproduce errors through test scripts
3. Modify source code
4. Iterate until tests pass

### CLAUDE.md Files
- Project-level configuration files
- Pre-loaded critical context
- Combine with autonomous exploration via tools

---

## Applicability
- Claude Code usage optimization
- Agentic coding workflow design
- Project configuration for AI-assisted development
